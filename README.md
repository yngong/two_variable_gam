## Development environment

- **R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)**
- **Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)**
- **Running under: macOS Catalina 10.15.2**
- **Package requirements and versions:**
	- ggplot2_3.3.3
	- cowplot_1.1.1
	- mgcv_1.8-35
	- magick_2.7.2
	- modules_0.10.0
	- ggpubr_0.4.0

## Input and output files

- **Input (data folder)**
	- **covid-19\_elisa\_74_OD\_logNT.tsv**: include real NT titer and ELISA OD values of S1 and RBD.
	- **covid-19_infection.tsv**: include the information of SARS-CoV-2 postive and negative cases and their ELISA OD values of S1 and RBD

- **Output (output folder)**
	- figures in manuscript (fig2.pdf and fig2a-2f.pdf)
	- predication of linear regression and GAM (fig3e.csv and fig3f.csv)
	- raw data and GAM plots of cross validation (cv\_data\_in_paper/cv\*.csv and cv\*.pdf)

	
## Usage and command lines

- The main program includes three different modules, which were used to generate two-variable GAM plot (d3\_plot.r) and linear regression (r2\_plot.r) for predicting NT titers, and dot plot for comparing SARS-CoV-2 postive and negative cases (dot\_plot.r). Command lines are as follows.

```
Rscript main.r
```

- run the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare different models, and save output as aic_table.csv

```
Rscript aic.r
```

- run five-fold cross validation of gam
 
```
Rscript cv.r
```
